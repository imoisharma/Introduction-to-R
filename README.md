# Introduction-to-R
This repository is devoted to all those students who are eagerly interested in learning R. In this I tried to cover all the basics of R and hope you like it. Share it. Comment it.  I have also taken some helps from Professor. Asef Nazari notes. Prof. Asef Nazari teaches Data Science using R at Monash University, Australia.
